# Smart-Sling
The Smart Sling is a medical sleeve that provides therapeutics via thermoelectric heating+cooling, constriction pressure, and connects to iOS via Bluetooth for user control. This is the general repository for the code for the Smart Sling project. Meant for general storage and documentation for the team, not particularly organized.
"Cornerstone Final Report Group 13.pdf" details the project.
