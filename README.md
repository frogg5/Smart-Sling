# Smart-Sling
This is the general repository for the code for the Smart Sling project. Meant for general storage and documentation for the team, not particularly organized
The Smart Sling is a medical sleeve that provides therapeutics via thermoelectric heating+cooling, constriction pressure, and connects to iOS via Bluetooth for user control.
"Cornerstone Final Report Group 13.pdf" details the project.
